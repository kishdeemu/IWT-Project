	<h3 align="center">What is SLEVS?</h3>
    <p align="center">Travel formalities for foreign Citizens Travelling to Sri Lanka. Individuals who wish <br>
    to travel to Sri Lanka are exempt from visa requirements. This is made possible under the Visa Waiver <br>
	Program (VWP) of which the Sri Lanka is a participant. When travelling to Sri Lanka all individuals will<br>
	however need to obtain an approvalby SLEVS(Sri Lankan Electronic Visa System) before they will be allowed <br>
	to enter the country.The Sri Lankan government saw it fit to set up a pre-screening system for all <br>
	travelers from Visa Waiver countries. Thus the Sri Lankan Electronic Visa System or SLEVS was born<br>
	and became a mandatory component of the Visa Waiver Program on January 12, 2009. The SLEVS program <br>
	is an online, e visa application system that allows the Department of immigration  to pre-screen all<br>
	travelers who enjoy exemption from VISA requirementsbefore they board a SL bound airplane or ship.<br><br>

	SLEVS for Authorization Tourist Trip or Short-Term Business Trip <br><br> 

	The application process for SLEVS can take up to a few weeks, although the SLEVS Website recommends<br>
	that the application be made at least 72 hours before departure. We recommend that you avoid applying<br>
	in rush, take some time to ensure that you understand the application process, and verify your validity<br>
	for an SLEVS before applying. If your application is denied, you will have to apply for a B-1 Visitor<br>
	Visa or B-2 Tourist Visa.<br><br>

	The SLEVS is a prerequisite for citizens of VWP member countries who wish to travel by air or sea to <br>
	Sri Lanka as a final destination or in transit to another destination. There's no guarantee that you <br>
	will gain permission to enter SL even when granted a travel authorization. Remember that it is not a <br>
	visa. Sri Lankan immigration will conduct checks to ascertain the validity of your travel authorization.<br><br> 

	There are four steps to the SLEVS application process. You will first need to download the SLEVS form<br>
	then fill in the required data and submit the form electronically. The next step is to submit the required<br>
	payment. You will then receive a confirmation email reflecting the final decision. This will one of <br>
	three responses: Authorization Approved, Authorization Pending or Travel Not Authorized. <br><br>

	SLEVS is valid for entry into SL for two years, but you are only allowed to stay a maximum of ninety<br>
	days per visit. This 90 days is calculated from the day immigration grants you access and you enter the<br>
	country. In case of you have lost your SLEVS, you can click on the link for further informations. You can<br>
	also have a look at our SLEVS glossary for explanations.<br><br>
