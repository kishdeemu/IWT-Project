    <h1 align="center">Overview</h1>
    <p>If you want to work in Sri Lanka temporarily as a nonimmigrant, under Sri Lanka immigration law, you need a specific visa based on the type of work you will be doing. Most temporary worker categories require that your prospective employer or agent file a petition, which must be approved by the Department of Immigration and Emmigration Sri Lanka (DIESL) before you can apply for a work visa.<br><br>
    All applicants for visas must have a petition approved on their behalf by DISEL The petition, Form I-129, must be approved before you can apply for a work visa at the Embassy or Consulate. When your petition is approved, your employer or agent will receive a Notice of Action, Form I-797, which serves as your petition's approval notification. The consular officer will verify your petition approval through the Department of Immigration and Emigration during your interview.<br><br>
    You must bring your I-129 petition receipt number and a copy of your Form I-797 to your interview at the Embassy or Consulate in order to verify your petition's approval. Please note that approval of a petition does not guarantee issuance of a visa if you are found to be ineligible for a visa under Sri Lanka immigration law.</P>
    
    <h1 align="center">Visa Descriptions and Qualifications</h1>
    <p><b>H-1B (specialty occupation)</b><br>
    An H-1B visa is required if you are coming to Sri Lanka to perform services in a pre-arranged professional job. To qualify, you must hold a bachelor's or higher degree (or an equivalent degree) in the specific specialty for which you seek employment. DISEL will determine whether your employment constitutes a specialty occupation and whether you are qualified to perform the services. Your employer is required file a labor condition application with the Department of Labor concerning the terms and conditions of its contract of employment with you.<br><br>
    <b>H-2A (seasonal agricultural workers)</b><br>
    An H-2A visa allows Sri Lanka employers to bring foreign nationals to the Sri Lanka to fill temporary agricultural jobs for which Sri Lanka workers are not available. An H-2A nonimmigrant classification applies to you if you seek to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature in the Sri Lanka on a temporary basis. A U.S. employer (or an association of Sri Lanka agricultural producers named as a joint employer) must file a Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker, on your behalf.<br><br>
    <b>H-2B visa (skilled and unskilled workers)</b><br>
    This visa is required if you are coming to the Sri Lanka to perform a job which is temporary or seasonal in nature and for which there is a shortage of Sri Lanka workers. Your employer is required to obtain a Department of Labor certification confirming that there are no qualified Sri Lanka workers eligible for the type of employment on which your petition is based.<br><br>
    <b>H-3 (trainee)</b><br>
    An H-3 visa is required if you are coming to the Sri Lanka to receive training from an employer in any field of endeavor, other than graduate education or training, for a period of up to two years. You can be paid for your training and "hands-on" work is authorized. Training cannot be used to provide productive employment and cannot be available in your home country.<br><br>
    <b>H-4 (dependents)</b><br>
    If you are the principal holder of a valid H visa, your spouses, including same-sex spouses, and/or unmarried children (under age 21) may receive an H-4 visa to accompany you to the Sri Lanka. However, your spouse/children are not permitted to work while in the Sri Lanka.</P>
    
    <h1 align="center">When to Apply</h1>
    <p>The Embassy or Consulate may process your visa application up to 90 days prior to the beginning of employment status as noted on your I-797. However, when making your travel plans, please note that due to Federal regulations, you can only use the visa to apply for entry to the Sri Lanka starting ten days prior to the beginning of the approved status period noted on your I-797.</p>
    
    <h1 align="center">Application Items</h1>
    If you apply for visa, you must pay your $190 application fee and submit the following:<br><br>
